# Week 23 Project — Battleship Spring app

## Context
I lost a bet with a friend and he challenged me that for the next 52 weeks, during weekends I need to create from scratch a new project.

For this week we decided to transform the Battlesip CLI app I did last week into a spring app and I'm allowed to work on it only Sunday.

## The rules are the following:
*   Each Friday night, me and him will talk about what project I need to do.
*   Mostly he will decide for me, but I’m allowed to suggest and do my own ideas if he agrees on them.
*   Once the project is decided, he will tell me if I’m allowed to work Saturday and Sunday, or only Sunday.
(Surely this won’t backfire at some point by underestimating a project, right? 😅)

## About the project
More information about the game and rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

* To put your ships on the table, drag and drop from the menu to the board, you can choose if you want it vertically or horizontally
